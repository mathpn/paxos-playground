# paxos-playground

Implementation of Paxos algorithm based on [Paxos Made Simple](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf) paper, which distills the original paper [The Part-Time Parliament](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf).

Testing is done using deterministic simulation testing (DST) based on [this blog post](https://poorlydefinedbehaviour.github.io/posts/deterministic_simulation_testing/). This testing method is discussed more generally in this [other blog post](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-08-20-deterministic-simulation-testing.html).
